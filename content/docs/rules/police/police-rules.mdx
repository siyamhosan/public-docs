# Police Rules

Being a police officer at Legacy Roleplay is a huge privilege. It allows you to engage in some very interesting and awesome roleplay scenarios. In addition, you get to enforce the law! However, to ensure high-quality roleplay from the police, we have set a few rules.

## (8.1) Use of Tasers

Tasers (non-lethal force) should be used unless there is a direct danger to surrounding officers or civilians or otherwise instructed by a high-ranking officer. Otherwise, lethal force can be used to terminate the danger.

<Callout type="info">
  **Prefer non-lethal:** Use tasers when possible, only escalate to lethal force when necessary.
</Callout>

## (8.2) Off-Duty Equipment

When going off-duty as an officer, you are to dispose of any equipment and vehicles that you got from the police department. You can not get equipment from the PD while off-duty.

## (8.3) Police Corruption

Police corruption is permitted so long as there is a story behind it. Using the role as an excuse to benefit friends and/or gangs which your other character is a part is not allowed.

<Callout type="warning">
  Corruption must have proper roleplay behind it, not just as an excuse to help friends.
</Callout>

## (8.4) Detective Cases

Detectives are not allowed to work on cases that their other characters are involved in. This is to avoid any metagaming.

## (8.5) Value of Life

Police must value the lives of their own and any other civilian if involved in a criminal situation.

## (8.6) Evidence Locker

Police cannot take out items from the evidence locker in order to profit from it.

<Callout type="error">
  Taking items from evidence for personal gain is strictly prohibited.
</Callout>

## (8.7) Negotiators

Negotiators can not be taken as hostages.

## (8.8) Weapon Matching

If Criminals are using Pistols, Police must use Pistols too in a code red situation. However, if criminal uses SMG, RIFLES, etc police can use their weapons according to the situation.

<Callout type="info">
  **Exception:** On Jewelry Robbery Heist it's required to use class 2 weapons to do the heist so Police can use SMG/Shotguns too.
</Callout>

## (8.9) Post-Shootout Investigation

After a shootout in cops vs crim situation, FIB/Officers can go investigate the scene (followed by NLR 5.1,5.2) even if the cops lose the fight.

<Callout type="info">
  This allows for stricter possible consequences for a scenario that leads to a player's death. PD will allow investigative roleplay. More warrants will be written for criminals. Criminals will have to be more mindful of shooting cops.
</Callout>
