# General Rules

These are the fundamental rules that apply to all players regardless of role or situation.

## (2.1) Vehicle Death Match (VDM)

Vehicle Death Match (also known as VDM) is strictly prohibited. In Legacy Role-play, we define VDM as the intentional use or attempt of a vehicle to kill or injure another person.

<Callout type="error">
  **VDM is a zero-tolerance rule. Violations result in permanent bans.**
</Callout>

### (2.1.1) Definition

VDM is the intentional use or attempt of a vehicle to kill or injure another person.

### (2.1.2) Self-Defense Exception

Any act in which a person uses his vehicle as a weapon to protect his life from direct or immediate threat shall not be considered VDM. The direct or immediate threat in this situation is defined as someone who is actively trying to harm your life at the moment.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important:** If someone tries to kill you and tries to flee the scene without being able to finish the job, he or she will no longer be considered a direct threat to your life.
</Callout>

## (2.2) Random Death Match (RDM)

Random Death Match (also known as RDM) is the act of killing/downing someone without Quality Role-play.

<Callout type="warning">
  In Quality Role-play, you must always have a proper backstory before taking someone's life directly.
</Callout>

After pointing a gun at someone, you need to give people an encouraging and adequate time to obey your orders (e.g. during a robbery, the person at Gunpoint can shoot 3 seconds later if they don't listen to your orders).

<Callout type="error">
  **Note:** We do not consider quick countdown as Quality Roleplay.
</Callout>

## (2.3) Fear RP

Fear RP is required. This means you always have to evaluate your life and act accordingly in the situation. For example, if a gun is aimed at you, you need to listen to the commands given by the gunman or anyone related to the person to ensure your own survival.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Not showing Fear RP when your life is in danger is a rule violation.**
</Callout>

## (2.4) Modding and Scripting

Changing the functionality of the game or altering the way our systems/scripts work (also known as modding and scripting) is strictly prohibited on our servers and will result in a **permanent ban**.

## (2.5) Bugs and Glitches

The presence of Bugs and Glitches is inevitable as the server is constantly updated. None of these in-game bugs or glitches are allowed to be used for your convenience.

<Callout type="info">
  If you discover a bug or glitch that could be used, you should immediately notify any available staff member.
</Callout>

This includes but is not limited to:
- **(2.5.1)** To preserve/recover the vehicle for a complete repair.
- **(2.5.2)** Transfer of cash within one's own Character.

## (2.6) Combat Logging

Disconnecting the game during any Roleplay Situation is called Combat Logging. Some examples:
- Disconnecting during a fight
- Disconnecting when police are chasing you
- Logging out while restrained

<Callout type="warning">
  We are aware of common game crashes and interrupted connection issues. Staff will check logs and make a decision. If your game crashes, log back in and surrender to police (if applicable) or explain the situation.
</Callout>

## (2.7) Trolling

Trolling is the intentional act of performing certain actions in order to provoke a reaction. We consider the following to be Trolling:
- Running around people for no reason when they are playing Roleplay
- Jumping in front of a moving car
- Obstructing people with your car for no reason
- Jumping from a multi-story building
- Teasing someone with unreasonable messages and Roleplay
- Using Soundboard / Voice Changer in City without taking permission

<Callout type="error">
  Depending on the severity, violations of this rule may result in a permanent ban without appeal.
</Callout>

## (2.8) Real-Life Transactions

Real-life item/money transactions are not allowed for any item in the game. This is unethical and strictly prohibited in FIVEM. Donations made for Server Maintenance are not included.

## (2.9) Whitelisted Job Interference

Sending a text message to the number of any whitelisted job, calling them, looting, or taking them hostage, appropriate action will be taken.

## (2.10) Ban Evasion

BAN evade is not allowed to indulge in deception. This means that once you have a BAN, you will not be able to play using another account to access the server or try to do anything that might make the staff think you are a different person.

## (2.11) Advertising

Legacy Roleplay will not allow you to advertise any other Server / Community or any product/service under any circumstances. If anyone is found to have done so, he will be Ban Issued through our Discord.

## (2.12) Character Interaction

There can be no interaction between your characters. For example, you are not allowed to transfer or give money between them. This is not allowed using any medium (Middleman) and is a Bannable Offense.

## (2.13) Reporting Players

If you have a problem with someone in our community, please send a report via Report A Player Form. Include any evidence to make the case easier.
