# Heist and Other Scenarios

Comprehensive rules for all types of heists and criminal scenarios.

## (7.1) Prison Break

Prison break occurs while being taken from Mission Row to Rollingbrook Penitentiary. The initiative is Prison Transport, 30 seconds after the convoy leaves "Mission Row", not to "mag dump" the transport, but to strategically stop the convoy and recover your friend.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important:** Once the prisoner is brought to the prison yard, the transport is over. No fights in prisons or jails allowed.
</Callout>

- Prison transfer police can use a maximum of **5 car units** including prison buses
- No drive-by is allowed in Prison Escort
- Criminals can shoot to disable police vehicles but then have to fight on foot

## (7.2) Fear RP for Police

You have to show Fear RP to the police officers. You cannot show a gun / misbehave / taser in front of police officers without any reason. They can arrest you for it.

<Callout type="warning">
  Ordinary people do not go to the police without a reason and do not have fun or walk around with a gun in front of the police. Must show Fear RP in front of police officers.
</Callout>

## (7.3) Police Use of Force

If a police officer thinks his life is in danger or if he sees a life-threatening weapon or gun at the scene that could be damaged by the terrorists, the police officers may use a teaser immediately or if a fatal incident occurs in that situation. However, they can shoot directly in self-defense.

**(7.3.1)** - When a gang finds/blows up an agent's cover, they must state all the reasons to the agent before doing anything.

<Callout type="error">
  **Identifying the agent using discord roles, considered as meta and will result in a ban.** There must be strong evidence such as you saw them planting bugs, found out their badge, etc. "Gun Holster animation" can be considered as suspicious activity, but you can't identify the agent using it.
</Callout>

Crim/Gang can ambush the raiding party with their members (6 limit, driveby not allowed).

## (7.4) Store Robbery

**Max criminal can be 3 for the store Robbery. You can take 1 Hostage. There can max 3 Police with 3 Vehicle Units.**

<Callout type="warning">
  Robbing a STORE and leaving before cops show up is considered poor roleplay as you are clearly avoiding interaction with the police and doing it solely for the money.
</Callout>

## (7.5) Stockade Heist Rules

Maximum **5 people** can join in Stockade Robbery. But here is the thing other criminals can also join the situation. It will be free for all but with 5 people max per team. But you can't make multiple Teams from the same gangs as there is too much conflict.

- If police officers reach the situation they will give a warning first
- It can be a shoot-out situation at any time as Police or other criminals can join the situation
- Police can use max 5 officers (If there are multiple team Police can be max 8)
- Police should follow rule 8.8 for weapons

## (7.6) Bank Robbery

**Max 4 criminals team can join and 1 escaped vehicle. Police can max 5 units. If it's a code red situation +1 officer can be added.**

## (7.7) Jewelry Shop Heist

- There must be **3 people** to start the Robbery but **Max 5 people** can join the robbery
- Lower than 3 people can't do jewelry shop Heists
- Criminals need to take a minimum of **1 Hostage** to start the robbery
- Then the demand will be maxed **2**
- If there are 2 Hostages Robbers can demand a max of **3**
- Escape vehicles for robbers in front of the store will be maxed at **1**
- **6 Police** can join the situation (If Codered +1 officer) and **5 vehicle units** can join

## (7.8) Cargo Heist

**WL gang can max 5 / Civilians also Max 5**

<Callout type="warning">
  If You are part of a gang you can not make 2 Groups or 2 Friends can not make 2 groups cause it doesn't make sense in RP (Shooting someone).
</Callout>

- When You die Once You are not allowed to Go back again
- Your other group/friend can but there should be in RP conversation that they died
- Other Members can't just roaming around Cargo and give info. If we find anyone misuses it, They will be banned.

## (7.9) Multiple Crime Scenarios

Scenarios that include more than one crime, will be prioritized and the uses of force matrix will be as per crimes committed. For example: let's say two crimes have been committed doing jewelry & stockade at the same time, so in total 6+10 officers will be involved.

## (7.10) Stealing Emergency Vehicles

You can steal emergency vehicles but there should be a big reason or backstory to stealing the car. You can't just steal any emergency vehicles to roam around or for other use. Abusing this you might face consequences.

## (7.11) Code Red Situations

If you start a code red with a background of the RP story, you must have a valid reason to start the fight with the police. If the fight starts middle of the streets you can do a semi-driveby or escape from the situation.

**In terms of Gangs/Civilians:**

Gangs/Civilians can do drive-bys with other gangs/Civilians. If the fight starts middle of the streets you can do a drive-by or escape from the situation.
