  Always coordinate with police at crime scenes when possible.
</Callout>

## (9.2) Off-Duty Equipment

When going on off-duty as a medic, you must dispose of any equipment and vehicles from the hospital.

## (9.3) Power Abuse

It is not the responsibility of EMS to abuse their powers as a medicine to assist friends.

<Callout type="error">

EMS is not for the recovery of persons killed in critical situations (gunfights, stab wounds, etc.) while on duty.

## ICU Rules

Also, read [Rules of Roleplay (3.5)](/docs/rules/roleplay/rules-of-roleplay#35-intensive-care-unit-icu) and follow the rules for ICU RP.

**Key Points:**
- ICU stay: Minimum 4h to 24h max
- Reasons: Code red, Gang Fight violence, Shots in the body, etc.
- Can only be checked out when a qualified EMS clears you to leave
- Playing without clearance is Fail RP
