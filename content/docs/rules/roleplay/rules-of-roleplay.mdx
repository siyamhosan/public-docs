# Rules of Roleplay

These rules govern how roleplay situations should be handled.

## (3.1) Heist Timing

Partaking in ANY heists 30 minutes (in real-time) before or after a scheduled restart is not allowed. Unscheduled restarts are an exemption, however, if caught after an announcement is made, you may face punishment.

<Callout type="warning">
  Plan your heists accordingly to avoid scheduled restarts.
</Callout>

## (3.2) Character Names

Make sure your name is reasonable and realistic. If your name violates this rule you will be forced to choose a new name.

## (3.3) Hospital Safety

No criminal activity inside ANY hospital. This rule is void if someone attempts to run into a hospital as a safe haven when they are already in a roleplay situation.

<Callout type="error">
  Hospitals are safe zones. No weapons, no criminal activity allowed.
</Callout>

## (3.4) EMS Service

If EMS is on duty and you fail to use the service by bringing someone to a hospital yourself, you are removing EMS roleplay. The exception to this is if you get no response from EMS after 3 minutes.

## (3.5) Intensive Care Unit (ICU)

If EMS decides to put your character into the intensive care unit (ICU), your character must stay in ICU for a minimum of 4h to 24h max. The reasons could be after code red, Gang Fight violence, or Shots in the body, etc.

<Callout type="warning">
  You can only be checked out when a qualified EMS clears you to leave. Playing the same character again without getting clearance will be considered as Fail RP.
</Callout>

If it was a police situation then the police will process you but with lower Jailtime etc.

## (3.6) Whitelisted Gang Activities

You may not use things like the cocaine mission, start oxy runs or use the gun-running computer unless you are a member of a whitelisted gang.

## (3.7) Emergency Vehicle Theft

You are not allowed to steal emergency vehicles unless obtained via a roleplay scenario, not including holding up EMS/PD employees to get the vehicle without roleplay behind it.

## (3.8) Connection Issues

If you encounter any internet connection or power connection problem at the scene, you should immediately report it to #Game Crash and when the connection is restored/explain the problem at OOC and participate in the Last Position at the scene.

## (3.9) Rule Discussion During RP

If anyone mentions server rules during an RP situation (example: "You are not doing it right" / "I know every rule don't judge me" / "Sir server rules e ai niyom nai" etc.) You will get kicked/Ban for this also.

<Callout type="error">
  Never discuss rules during active roleplay. Report issues after the situation is resolved.
</Callout>
