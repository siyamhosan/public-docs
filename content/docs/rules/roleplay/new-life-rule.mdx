# New Life Rule (NLR)

The New Life Rule governs what your character remembers after death or serious injury.

## (5.1) When NLR Begins

When a new life rule begins:
- You are sentenced to death.
- You Re-Spawn took.

## (5.2) NLR Exceptions

The NLR does not apply to the following:

<Callout type="info">
  **Exceptions:** These situations are exempt from the New Life Rule.
</Callout>

- Your character is obviously a victim of VDM.
- Your character is clearly a victim of RDM.
- If you are down (injured / unconscious) and waiting for resuscitation
- You have been disconnected from the game.

## (5.3) When Revived

When in a shootout situation you're "Dead" you forget the last 15 minutes of Roleplay.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Memory Loss:** You cannot remember anything about how you died and you cannot return to the scene of the death based on the knowledge of that death.
</Callout>

- Regardless of getting treatment from Pillbox or being taken to the hospital
- A person can remember fully the entire scenario that took place before they were dead
- You can't ruin any medical roleplay while you're injured
- You must play the injured person's role

## (5.4) When Re-spawn/Airlift

This rule can be simplified to a person who will only suffer memory loss if they have to take an airlift to the pillbox. If this happens you can't remember what happens to you and you can't reveal or share any information.

## (5.5) When Downed

You will not be able to communicate with anyone while unconscious, and will not be able to provide any kind of information to Teammates in any way.

<Callout type="info">
  **Injury Exception:** Suppose you are injured, you are unconscious by a gun or any other deadly weapon in which you cannot speak in any way. If the situation is very complicated then you can pretend to speak like an injured person.
</Callout>

## Key Points

- **15 minutes** of memory loss after death
- Cannot return to the scene of death
- Cannot remember how you died
- Must play injured/unconscious role appropriately
