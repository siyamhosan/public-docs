# First Steps

Your guide to getting started in the city after creating your character.

## Getting to the City

When you finish your character you will notice that you spawn at the airport and that you will need to make your way into the city. At this point you have 3 options:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Walk" description="No risk, but slow. Safe option for new players." />
  <Card title="Get a Friend to Pick You Up" description="Low risk and fast. Ask in Discord or OOC chat." />
  <Card title="Hotwire a Vehicle" description="High risk but fast. Requires lockpick and can lead to jail time if caught." />
</Cards>

<Callout type="warning">
  **Hotwiring Warning:** Without a lockpick, it is normal to fail a few hotwires. Be patient and don't get caught as you could end up in jail on your first day!
</Callout>

## Getting Essential Supplies

Now that you have managed to make your way into the city you will want to acquire a few items.

When reaching the city you will want to locate a convenience store to obtain important supplies.

<Callout type="info">
  **Recommended Starter Items:**
  - Phone
  - 3-5 Sandwiches
  - 3-5 Water Bottles
  - 2-3 First Aid Kits
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  **Note:** Some stores do not have ATMs so you may not have access to any money. If that is the case, try a different store for now.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  **Managing Money:** Use **/cash** to view your cash and **/bank** to view your bank balance. You can also check your bank balance using the Bank app on your phone.
</Callout>

## Getting Your ID Card

<Callout type="error">
  **Critical:** The ID card is extremely important! It counts as your driver's license, firearm license, and personal identifier. Without it, you can get in trouble with the law.
</Callout>

The ID card can be acquired at the **courthouse located near the Pillbox hospital**.

**How to use your ID:**
1. Press **"K"** to open your inventory
2. Drag the ID icon to the use button
3. Or press one of your hotkeys (1-5) if it's in your hotbar

<Callout type="info">
  **Tip:** This drag-and-drop method works for most items in your inventory. Items can also be assigned to hotkeys 1-5 for quick access.
</Callout>

## Using Your Phone

Your phone is one of the most useful things in the Legacy server. To access the phone you will want to press **"P"**.

### Phone Applications:

- **Twitter:** Your basic news/community feed where people can post public messages.
- **Phone:** Can be used to contact emergency services in the favourites tab and call others.
- **Messages:** Can be used to text numbers and send your GPS coordinates.
- **Contacts:** Used to save phone numbers. You can also text someone from this application.
- **Settings:** View your phone number and change phone settings.
- **Bank:** Used to view how much money you have in the bank.
- **Stock Market:** Nothing to see here yet.
- **Camera:** Use your camera. You can zoom in by scrolling or even take a selfie by hitting the up-arrow on your keyboard!
- **Dark Chat:** A secret way to have a group conversation.
- **9GAG:** Have a look at a few memes! To look at the next picture, hit the right arrow key on your keyboard. To go back, hit the left arrow key on your keyboard.

## Getting Your First Job

Now that you have all your supplies it's now time to get a job and acquire some money so you can buy your own car and apartment!

To get your first job you will need to make your way to the **Life Invader building**. You will have a few jobs you can choose from. Some of them will pay better than others.
