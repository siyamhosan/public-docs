  **Important:** If you decide to select a non-playable character (anything other than multiplayer models, aka NPC) as your main character you will have a limited wardrobe and will not be able to put on a mask or any other accessories.

Press **"G"** when done to save your character.

  **Need a Reskin?** If you accidentally press "G" and you are not finished, please use `/report` and ask for a reskin by detailing to staff members what has just happened. You can also visit a clothing store to change your clothing later!
