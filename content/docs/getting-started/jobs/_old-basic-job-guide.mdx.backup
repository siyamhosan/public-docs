You will be required to purchase a transporter truck from the Southern Docks - this will cost you **$2500** (found in the second picture with the orange truck) You will see many cargo stations around the city labeled by the "truck" (circled in red) or "upwards arrow" symbols (circled in blue).

After signing up for the job your first order of business should be picking up a taxi for **$1500** (found in the picture below). This is a one-time payment and you receive full ownership of the vehicle. This vehicle is personal and thereby you have the ability to customize it.

The garbage truck can be picked up at the Waste Collector HQ (found in the picture below). Upon arrival, you will need to find the red arrow that should be located on a set of stairs in order for you to start the job. You simply drive to the assigned area and pick up the trash. You also have the ability to obtain random items when handling the trash. After collecting all the trash you simply return to HQ and drop it off.
